In this concluding chapter, we propose two ways to synthesize the scientific contributions of this book.
The first discuss several major principles that can be retained for constructing relevant theories for urban science in relation with the contents of the chapters of the book.
The second part identifies communities of scientific discussion by analyzing a citation network capturing the scientific neighborhood of this book, constructed starting from the works quoted in the bibliographies of the chapters and enlarging to the papers citing them.
This mining of digital bibliographical data confirms the wide inter-disciplinarity of urban questions justifying the plurality of urban theories and opening a variety of solutions for complementing them and coupling their generic models.
We finally suggest directions for the construction of integrated theories, in particular through the coupling of simulation models corresponding to the different approaches to be bridged.
