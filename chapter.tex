\abstract{Urban systems intrinsically need multiple complementary theories to be understood. This concluding chapter synthesizes the approaches developed in the book and aims at showing their complementarity and how new approaches making bridges can be developed. We first provide a broad overview of the theories and disciplines that the viewpoints developed in the book link to. We then extend this synthesis through citation network analysis, reconstructing a citation network from the references cited by authors, and identify disciplines from community detection within this network what allows to discuss the relative positioning of approaches. We finally discuss how modeling and simulation could be a systematic entry to the coupling of theories, and recall best practices in this particular context of building integrative complex simulation models of social systems.

\section{Complementary urban theories}

\textit{section par Denise : synthesis of the book, thematic link between theories used by the different chapters, positioning of disciplines and their relations (can insist on sociological aspects of science, as citation network analysis in the second section is a very reductionist view of the question)}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Citation network analysis}

We now turn to a quantitative analysis of the relative positioning of disciplines and approaches discussed above. We propose to use citation network analysis as a proxy to understand the structure of that scientific environment, what captures a single dimension of practices but contains relevant information on endogenous disciplinary structures. We use the method of \cite{} to construct a citation network at depth two, from the references cited by chapters of this book.

The bibliography of each chapter was manually indexed to ensure correct citing references retrieval during the data collection process. Furthermore, for performance purposes, but also to ensure a focus of the network content on urban issues, references clearly out of the scope and which would yield a significant part of the final network totally unrelated to urban theories (the paper on morphogenesis \cite{} is a typical example, being anectdotically cited by papers relating to urban issues, but also massively cited by several branches of biology). The corpus used is available as raw data, along with the code and results, on the open git repository of the project at \url{}.

\section{Modeling and simulation}

\textit{section par Arnaud : version anglaise des 9 commandements de Banos pour la modelisation et simulation en SHS}

\comment[JR]{suggestions :
\begin{itemize}
	\item specificité des commandements dans le cas de la geographie ?
	\item proposition à amender / discuter selon cotre positionnement : le couplage des modeles (de simulation) et donc la construction de modeles intégrés est une façon robuste de coupler les théories - d'où l'intérêt des commandements dans le contexte de ponts entre les differentes theories urbaines ? (l'intérêt du couplage en lui meme est déjà présent ici)
\end{itemize}
